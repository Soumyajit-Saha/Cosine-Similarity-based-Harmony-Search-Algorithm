The file normal.m is used to perform normalisation on the feature sets in order to find out the cosine similarity between features and also to divide the datasets into training and testing datasets in the ratio 2:1.
The file intiateHM.m is used to create a initial Harmony memory with size HMS containing feature subsets.
The file HS_all_feature runs the algorithm over the Harmony memory.
Classification is carried out by classification.m file
